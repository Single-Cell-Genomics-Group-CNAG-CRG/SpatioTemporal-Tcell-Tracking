# Spatio-temporal T cell tracking for personalized TCR-T designs in childhood cancer

Directories contain Jupyter Notebooks (JN) and corresponding HTML reports in order to reproduce the results from this project. Each folder starting by *SCGRES\_\** is a batch of samples of the project:
- SCGRES_83_84: contains PBMCs cells from blood time points T1,T2,T3
- SCGRES_99_100: contains CD45+ cell-sorted fraction from the Tumor at timepoint 0 (T0), CD3+ enriched fraction of T0 and PBMCs of time point T5.
- SCGRES_105_106: contains PBMCs of time point T6.
- SCGRES_119_120: contains PBMCs of time points T4 and T7.
- SCGRES_124_125: contains CD3+ cells from *in vitro* culture experiment: cells in 41BB+ fraction, cells in 41BB- fraction and cells from the control condition. 

Each directory described above contains a `scripts/` with the JN and `reports/` with the HTML output results of corresponding JN that were run with data of that specific folder.
The parent `scripts/` and `reports/` directories contain general analysis using data from different batches.
